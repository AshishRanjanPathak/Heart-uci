# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease based on various health metrics using Python and machine learning. The dataset contains several features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, which are used to train and evaluate the model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple algorithms for prediction and evaluation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning and evaluation
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the project.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following variables:
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient
- **cp**: Chest pain type
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

## Results
The project evaluates the model using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more advanced machine learning models.
- Improving data preprocessing techniques.
- Optimizing model performance with hyperparameter tuning.
